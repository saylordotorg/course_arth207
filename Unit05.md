**Unit 5: The Enlightenment** <span id="5"></span> 
*As the Rococo style enjoyed popularity in France, another, more
serious-minded* *style was emerging in tandem with the scientific and
philosophical developments of the Enlightenment.  In stark contrast to
the frivolity and gaiety of the Rococo, art of the Enlightenment period
is sentimental, moralizing, and—at times—satirical.  Mirroring the rapid
political and scientific changes of the time, art of this period shows a
greater interest in social concerns, morality, justice, and human
progress.  During the Enlightenment, the issues we often associate with
the Modern era begin to emerge, and these issues are palpable in the
period’s art.*
