**Unit 1: Baroque Art in Italy and Spain** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit will introduce students to Italian art from around 1600 as
Italian art transitioned away from the ideals of the Renaissance period
toward something new.  Much of the art produced in Italy at this time
was influenced by the crisis of the Catholic Church, as it was
challenged by the Reformation.  It sought to fight this challenge with
its own movement, known as the Counter-Reformation.  To promote its
cause, the Catholic Church commissioned religious art that sought to
move and inspire the masses.  The young artist Caravaggio emerged in
this environment and exerted enormous influence on Baroque art around
Europe.  Nearby Spain—also a bastion of the Counter-Reformation—dealt
with similar issues as its Italian neighbors, although it was informed
by its own distinct artistic heritage.*
