**Unit 3: Baroque Art in France and England** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, we turn to Baroque art produced in France and England. 
In France,* *much as in the Netherlands, art is greatly influenced by
Baroque art in Italy—albeit tinged with the unique social and political
conditions of its own culture.  The influence of Caravaggio is felt here
as elsewhere, but the unique role of the monarchy resulted in a courtly
style unique to France that culminated with the art and architecture
produced for Louis XIV.  In England, there was less of a local painting
tradition and the Baroque is mainly expressed via architecture, which
borrows from Italy and France to create a distinct English Baroque
architecture.*
