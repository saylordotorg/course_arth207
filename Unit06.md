**Unit 6: Neoclassicism** <span id="6"></span> 
*This final unit culminates with the emergence of Neoclassicism. 
Something of an extension of (and logical next stage of) the Age of
Enlightenment, Neoclassicism coincides with several political
developments and conflicts—most notably, the American and French
revolutions.  Looking to classical antiquity as an ideal of artistic,
political, and moral virtue, artists (among others) developed a new
(“neo”) classical tradition that suited the political climate of the
time.  Subject matter, style, medium, and genre were all borrowed from
Classical antiquity but were overlaid with contemporary subjects and
tastes.*
