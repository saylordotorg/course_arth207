**Unit 4: Rococo** <span id="4"></span> 
*On the heels of the Baroque, a new style (the Rococo) emerged—a style
that was* *at once more intimate and more ostentatious that the
Baroque.  The heart of this movement was in France, where it was
produced for the personal enjoyment of the most elite patrons, although
it did spread to other parts of Europe and to the American colonies. 
Generally speaking, Rococo art is sumptuous and decadent.  Eschewing the
religious and genre scenes of the Baroque, Rococo art favored subjects
involving pleasure and fantasy.  Although this style did enjoy
popularity outside of France, it is most associated with the elite
circles of the French aristocracy and was soon replaced with a more
sober artistic aesthetic.*
