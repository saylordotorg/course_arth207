**Unit 2: Baroque Art in the Netherlands** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, we move on to look at Baroque art as it emerged in the
Netherlands.  In the Baroque period, the Netherlands was split into the
Northern Netherlands (the Dutch Republic) and the Southern Netherlands
(Flanders).  Flanders was Catholic, whereas the Dutch Republic was
Protestant; therefore, there is a sharp divide in the subject matter and
styles of Baroque art in each region.  Nonetheless, the two regions
remained geographically and historically connected and shared an earlier
Renaissance tradition that influenced the art of each region.  Although
Baroque art in the Netherlands has a distinctly local flair, there is
clear evidence of Italian influence, suggesting the international
character of Baroque art.*
