This course will examine the history of Western art from approximately
1600 to approximately 1800—a period that bridges the gap from the
Renaissance to the earliest days of the Modern era. Beginning with the
Baroque in Counter-Reformation Italy and concluding with Neoclassicism
in the late 18th century, we will trace the stylistic developments in
Europe and America through a variety of religious, political, and
philosophical movements. The class begins with the Baroque, which was
the immediate successor to the Renaissance and to Renaissance humanism,
and we will examine this period by regions (Italy and Spain, the
Netherlands, and France and England). Next, the course moves on to
explore the development of two opposing styles that emerged in the 18th
century: Rococo and Enlightenment art. The course culminates with
Neoclassical art, its development in a politically turbulent France, and
its spread into other Western cultures, including Italy, England, and
the United States. Crucial to this course is the emergence of
characteristics (artistic, social, political, scientific, philosophical,
and religious) that anticipate the issues faced by Modern society in the
18th century and after. Long-accepted institutions, such as the Catholic
Church and the monarchy, reached their zenith in this environment and
were ultimately challenged. Reading assignments and lectures will
present an overview of this material, revealing the deep connection
between a culture’s sociopolitical climate and its art. By the time you
finish this course, you will be familiar with the most important art and
artists of Western civilization from approximately 1600 to 1800. You
will also have a greater understanding of the most important social and
political debates of the time. Moreover, you will be able to explain and
discuss the ways in which the themes, styles, and patronage of works of
art relate to the social, political, and religious environments in which
they were produced. The content covered in this course will prepare you
to study Modern art in the West.
